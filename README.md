•Overcame the black-box nature of machine learning by incorporating LIME and
SHAP techniques to enhance explainability and comprehensibility.
•Plotted feature importance, dependency plots, and interaction plots to visualize
the model's decision-making process, understand feature contributions, and
uncover potential feature interactions, thus providing insights to overcome the
black-box nature of the model.
